###React


#### Intro
Coming from world of Angular, React seemed to be the Wild Wild West.

Angular its a framework and hence its not easy to do a 1to1 comparison. As a framework it provides structure and consistency to Developers. As Angular 2.0 moves towards Web Components it becomes even more easy to reuse components by following the standards of the framework.

React on the other hand, is a library not a framework, which means the Developer has the freedom to do whatever he wants. A well known saying: "With great power comes great responsibility" and that is precisely React.


#### Set Up

Setting up React is pretty straightforward as any library.

```
  npm install --save react
```
